{**Problem Statement

Given an integer array Arr of size N, the task is to find the count of elements whose value is strictly greater than all of its previous elements.

Note:

The first element of the array should always be considered in the count.

An element is counted only if it is greater than every element before it.

Example

Input:
N = 5
Arr = {7, 4, 8, 2, 9}

Explanation:

7 is the first element → counted

8 is greater than all previous elements (7, 4) → counted

9 is greater than all previous elements (7, 4, 8, 2) → counted

Total such elements = 3

Output:
3 **}
